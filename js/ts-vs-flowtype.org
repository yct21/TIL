* Comparing achitecture of typescript and flowtype
** Typescript achitecture
TypeScript will walk through your program and build up a table of known types.
As it discovers values and expressions it assigns types to them immediately.
When TypeScript discovers an unknown type it must make a decision immediately,
which means either assigning it to any or throwing an error.
** Flow achitecture
Flow will build up a graph of all your values and expressions and their
relationships to one another. It will then start to assign types to each value
and expression. If it finds an unknown type it will make it an "open" type and
come back to it later.

Once Flow has a full graph of your program it will start to connect all the
dots, flowing types from one value to another. Open types take on the types of
all the values that flow into themâ€“ the resulting type is called the inferred
type.
